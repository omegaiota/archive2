I am a first-year EECS PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.csail.mit.edu/wojciech). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Jessica Hodgins](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkh/). My research interests lie at the intersection of differentiable physics, cloth simulation and computational fabrication. Outside of research, I enjoy ballet and photography. I am currently a company dancer of [Harvard Ballet Company](https://www.harvardballetcompany.org/).
