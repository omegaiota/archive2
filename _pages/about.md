I am a first-year EECS PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), advised by [Prof. Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.csail.mit.edu/wojciech). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Jessica Hodgins](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkh/). My research interests lie at the intersection of differentiable physics, cloth simulation and computational fabrication.

I was fortunate to receive the [2020 MIT Stata Family Presidential Fellowhsip](https://oge.mit.edu/finances/fellowships/presidential/). I've previously spent wonderful summers interning at FAIR(2020), Google(2019) and Activision Blizzard(2018).  

Outside of research, I enjoy ballet and photography. I am a member of [Harvard Ballet Company](https://www.harvardballetcompany.org/).
