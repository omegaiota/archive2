I am a first-year PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.csail.mit.edu/wojciech). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Jessica Hodgins](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkh/).
